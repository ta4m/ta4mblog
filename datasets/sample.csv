I work in the tech field and I LOVE apple entertainment products (I own many apple products and at work I work with several). I am very thrilled with my fire (I LOVE IT TOO!) because it works great as an entertainment product (and more affordable than my apple products). I also think the fire is a great product because of Amazons clout and support. Any tech product I buy needs to be useable for years and updateable during those years. The amazon market (still growing) is and will be getting better all the time. Why? Sheer number of devices sold by Amazon equals a large potential population of people who will buy software equals software programmers wanting to be a part of that market. Also in IT the biggest frustration is having an older device and not being able to update it or not being able to use new software or technology because the manufacturer does not update their devices (software) or provide backwards support. I am not saying that Amazon will continue to provide support (that remains to be seen), but the size, longevity, profitability and attitude of pro consumer of a company are determining factors and compared to other companies I would bet that Amazon will not disappoint.",5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5

I am pretty heavily invested in Kindle at this point so the Fire was a logical upgrade...or so I thought. It is a very nice device that is made unuseable, in my opinion, by several flaws. This thing is heavy. Much heavier than it looks. The major problem here is it is difficult to hold. The size and thin bezel just aggravate the situation. The iPad is heavier, but it is bigger so I can lay down, rest my elbows on the bed and hold it comfortably over my chest. I cant get into a comfortable position with the Fire. It is not easy to hold with one hand without accidental touches and it slipping out of my hand. It is also very easy to press the power button while reading. The more I read on the Fire the less I like it. It fails where the early Kindles hit a home run. Those Kindles ""disappeared in your hand"". With this one, I find myself thinking about the terrible ergonomics and realize I have been spacing out while reading the past four pages. The Carousel interface is an unmitigated disaster. I find myself constantly removing things from it. Why would I want my browsing history in there? The browser is the next issue. It is as slow as molasses. Going back and forth between pages takes way too long. Many times I thought the touch didn't register so I touch again and it takes me back multiple pages. The browser is nice to have and is a big plus compared to a Kindle 2, but don't plan to spend much time with it. Chances are the browser on your phone works better. There are many great things about the Fire like apps, Prime streaming, Netflix, etc., but I rarely use any of it. My primary use for it is as a reader. Unfortunately, as a reader, the Kindle Fire stinks. If you want a cheapo tablet this is worth a look. If you plan to read then steer clear.

I added my Netflix App. Bought the year of Amazon Prime (which allows me to watch unlimited Hey DUDE episodes, which I haven't seen since I was, like, 10).

The guy at Best Buy practically BEGGED me NOT to buy it, saying I wouldn't be happy...that I needed a Galaxy...but I stuck to my guns. I had researched the Fire and was sure it would be great.

You can store with Amazon and access your content with a Wi-Fi signal...or you can download TONS of stuff right onto the Fire.

The input/output ports were the primary attractions of the Thrive and my initial judgement has proved to be correct - the more I use the Thrive the better I like it. Since I bought the Thrive I have used it every day. I took it on a 15 day riverboat trip in Russia instead of my 13.3"" laptop and it was wonderful, compact and very useful. Good wifi on the boat so I could check email and web surf with the Thrive as if I were at home. Took over 500 pictures with a 10MP camera and all pictures were stored on the Thrive with plenty of room to spare. I keep a 16GB SD card almost full time in the SD slot, then loaded pictures using a USB SD card reader feeding into the full size USB port on the Thrive. Stored pictures both internally and on the 16GB SD card. So good backup. I also carry a 40 GB digital wallet with USB connection and backed up pictures to it - the USB connection worked flawlessly with the Thrive. I have used the full size HDMI port to connect the Thrive both to my HD TV set and also to an Epson projector using an HP HDMI to VGA connector dongle as my projector does not have an HDMI input. I also have an Android smart phone, so my calender synchs beautifully among Outlook on my desktop and my Google calender on the Thrive, the smart phone and my Toshiba Portege laptop. All told, the Thrive has more than met my expectations.

Let me break it down and explain PROs SIZE: The 7"" form factor is great, it is highly portable. I havent left it at home really since i got it. i'm not one to walk with a big bag, so this is great to drop into your purse or jacket/pants pockets (if you're a guy) It is very solid. So it's great for reading books as well. GESTURES: the playbook uses gestures to turn it on, change applications, and so on.. as there are no buttons on it except for the power and volume buttons. This has to be my FAVOURITE feature.. so ingenious! I own an ipod touch, now i find myself swiping on that screen. lol TRUE MULTITASKER: beauty about this tablet, you can run one application and simply swipe across to get to the other without stopping the first one.. pretty cool. I havent seen any lag on it, i have gotten up to 9 applications going at the same time and it still didnt slow down. BRIDGE: If you own a Blackberry smartphone, it will skyrocket the PB into more awesomeness. With the Bridge function, you can connect your phone with the playbook and use the phone's data plan to surf the internet on the playbook. Big help if there's no wifi around. You can also see a lot of information that's on the phone on the playbook. you can use BB messenger, memopad, calendar, messages (emails) on the playbook. FULL BROWSER WITH FLASH SUPPORT: when browsing, all flash material comes through just like you would on a computer. My mother is able to even check her farmville on it when she's in bed. Though it is laggy, but it will do the job. MEDIA - CAMERA: 3 MP forward facing, 5 MP rear; both capture Full HD 1080p video. you can get some beautiful photos and video. the mics are crisp and clear and loud. - SPEAKERS: 2 speakers on top of either ends of the tablet. They are nice and loud. - DISPLAY: 1024 x 600-pixel resolution. for the size of the tablet, videos looks great. very sharp and crisp FUTURE OS: I'm pretty sure BB10 operating system will come to the playbook which will just make the playbook a whole new device again... as i witnessed with Playbook OS 2.0 CONS: APPS: In truth, the Blackberry Appworld doesnt have a big apps market like the others have. But many times, the browser does well to access the website. (other tablets create apps because they dont have the flash support and isnt able to use the full website on it) There is no Netflix nor Skype app available, though there are apps that try to get around that. As far as i know, Netflix will not get to the Playbook neither. These dont affect me much because i dont have a netflix subscription and i dont use Skype. Some apps on the PB also tend to be a bit more pricey in comparison. The appstore is growing though so this con may do a turnaround at some point. WEIGHT: For it's size, it's kinda heavy and you can feel it in your hands after a bit. (especially when reading) Overall, I love the PB, i find more uses for it everyday.

It is exactly what I needed and I am glad I didn't wait on a Windows 8 product. I was pleased with the extra nips for the pen digitizer, folio, and the Bluetooth keyboard. The folio would have been much better if it had included a pocket. Because of the missing pocket, I plan to upgrade my folio by making my own (Yea for Pinterest!) as other folio options for this particular device are sorely lacking. The handwriting recognition using the pen digitizer is fantastic. The display is clean and crisp and larger than most though it smudges terribly. I am looking at adding a screen protector, but haven't done so yet. Inputting complex passwords in using the pen is difficult, but a quick click over to the onscreen keyboard helps. I am able to log into my Windows Server based network and work remotely. I was able to load Microsoft Office Enterprise and use all the related components without difficulty. Windows 7 flicks allow me to cut, paste, copy, etc with ease. The rotation works, but is a bit sluggish with compared to Apple products. The pinch is limited to supported software, and again it works fine for my use, but isn't as slick and responsive as the Apple products. How I use my device: I am in the medico-legal field. I use my tablet in physician exam rooms while meeting with patients to take notes. This is typically in portrait mode with the digitizer pen. I also do research on the web, write report (pull out the keyboard for this), and do tons of reading. I use Word, Excel, and Powerpoint daily. I have to interact with my server downloading and uploading documents regularly. I use the device on airplanes, in cars, and in hotel rooms. My only complaint is battery life. I came from an Asus Eee netbook with 10.5 hours of battery life while the slate eeks out about 3.5 hours. This battery life coupled with the sluggish rotation and pinch ability is the reason I gave the device 4 stars rather than 5. I have previously tried an Apple iPad and the ASUS Transformer.

I'm a long time ebook reader, but have always done so either on computers (with the kindle app or as PDFs of technical books), or on my iPad. At $200, I was seriously considering buying 3 of these to keep my 5 year old triplets occupied on long car trips (in-laws are ~4 hours away). 15 minutes after giving the Kindle fire to one of my boys, I get an email ""thanking"" me for my purchase of Scooby Doo, Season 1. I laugh, and start looking for a way to turn off 1 click purchasing. There are *no* parental controls! Further, the device freely mixes the display of content you own with content you can rent or buy - unless you are very careful, the muscle memory from hitting 'play' will just as easily purchase stuff. End result means I cannot hand this to my kids, and even when I use it myself, I need to be careful with the line between content I own and content they are trying to sell me. BTW, have you ever tried to return an electronic purchase to Amazon? Its possible, but generally not worth the time and effort for small $3-5 purchases. And that is the business model of the Kindle Fire. The device is also pretty useless unless you are near a wifi connection. It routinely 'unloads' apps you have purchased, so they have to be redownloaded and installed. This is a few-second hassle when at home near a fast internet connection, becomes painful in coffee shops and hotels, and unusable on a car trip.

I think this a great tablet and despite what other reviews have to say about it, its better to me than some of it's big named, higher priced competitors. The pros and cons are: Pros: Weight-Too many people complain about it being on the heavy end as far as tablets go but I like the weight. I don't feel like its going to break if I hold it or accidentally drop it. Ports-It comes with HDMI, USB and micro usb right out of the box...no adapters required. I've even hooked up a 500 GB hard drive and watched videos from it, as well as a USB based mouse which worked. Sound-Its pretty loud when playing games but this is also a con (see below) Camera-While it's not a high end camera, it takes good pictures and records quality video. It has a 2mp rear camera that also doubles as a video chat camera, and a 5mp front facing camera with flash. Cutomization-I like the fact that it is easily customizable to however you decide to set it up much like cell phones now with multiple screens. Battery life-On a single charge you can get a decent amount of use out of it. If you charge it, and put it to sleep and come back later , or even the next day, you can expect to still have atleast 90% of your charge left. Price-Compared to more expensive tablets, you get more in functionality without having to spend more money on adapters. Cons: Power cord-This is absolutely ridiculous how short this cord is. If you need to use it while its charging, be prepared to sit right next to the outlet. Screen freeze-I've occassionally had an issue with the screen freezing but I notice that it only happens when I haven't turned it off or left it in sleep mode with restarting for a couple of days. When I resart it, it works fine. Sound- As I stated before, the sound when playing games is outstanding. Whenever you watch movies, or videos, or play back any video you may have recorded, the sound drops off quite a bit. Also the sound for recorded video sometimes sounds garbled even when in a small room and near the tablet. Resolution-The screen resolution washes almost completely out when outside.

I've only had mine for a couple of days, but here is a few of the things I have done after I connected to my wifi. 1. Downloaded free and bought several fun games and useful utility apps. 2. Transferred some of my favorite tunes from my PC to the Kindle (via a USB to micro USB I already had.) 3. Streamed and watched some video via the 30 day free Prime subscription. Also got Prime free shipping on two items I bought later. 4. Free and purchased Kindle books transferred to the Fire and began reading them. 5. Subscribed to 2 of my favorite mags and downloaded the latest issues. 6. Went on the Internet and did a lot of web browsing. Read a couple of online newspapers for free. There is just so much to do. I'm about to try some streaming Internet radio next. I have no doubt it will work. So far, I spent $6. Yeah, I know I'm going to get a Prime subscription as well as eventually pay for those mag subscriptions, but it's all worth it! Kindle Fire operation is very intuitive. Swiping, tapping, double-tapping, hold tap, 2 finger spread and pinch pretty much takes care of any selection, moving or zooming task not requiring the keyboard... and when the keyboard is needed, it's readily available. Yeah, I've read other reviews. And there are some annoyances. 1. The screen gets a little smudged... but it's easy to clean. 2. You must be careful when using the keyboard... but practice makes it easy. 3. Slightly off-taps sometimes get ignored. 4. A bright sun can wash out the screen. 5.

The review below will focus on the 3 big winners so far, in our opinion: iPad2 for Apple, the Galaxy 10.1 for Android (see my review on its page), and the TouchPad for WebOS. Which to go with? Read on... Issue 1: Should my cell phone brand impact which Tablet I buy: Our Take: Yes. Stay with your brand and you will reap great rewards. Switch and you'll lose lots. WebOS Benefits: The Touchpad and Palm Pre 3 offer some truly powerful integration. Not only can you simply touch the Palm Pre to the Touchpad to sync screens and ""take it with you"" but the Touchpad can access 3g easily with the Palm Pre. Bye Bye monthly fees. Cool, too, is the ability to print wirelessly to HP wireless printers. Apple Benefits: iCloud service allows you to over-the-air sync your photos, music, movies etc. with ALL of your iOS 5 devices. And apps purchased for your iPhone sync (for free) to your iPad. Very cool. Android Benefits: Similar to WebOS, the Galaxy 10.1 can tether to many Android phones, such as the Droid X for FREE 3G. Also, any apps you download(ed) on your droid phone can be freely added to the Galaxy Tab. The Winner: None here. It really depends on which powerful integration benefits you want/need. But don't make the mistake of having one brand for phone and another for Tablet. You're going to really be losing out on some key features if you do that. No one seems to point this out in any of the reviews of any of these devices, and I have always found that suspicious. Any review not pointing this out as doing you a disservice. Issue 2: The Apps Our Take: Apple, Apple, Apple but for how long? The bottom line is that you get a Tab for the functions it performs. And that, of course, is through Apps. So any review downplaying the importance of App availability makes us skeptical of who the author is. We are by no means Apple fanatics, but we have to be honest: Apple is way ahead of the game here so that if you NEED an Tablet right now, meaning Summer 2011, your App experience is going to be much better with iPad. That doesn't mean I think you should buy an iPad, it just means that for the full experience of the TouchPad (or Galaxy), you're going to have to wait. We do believe the apps are coming, we really do, so if you are patient, you will have a great experience in 6 months or a year or two. But you have to consider that newer/better/cheaper devices will be out by then. So if you definitely want a TouchPad I'd wait until that happens. If you need one NOW, then just understand that you're NOT going to have the full experience just yet. You will have the biggies like facebook, but you will miss other apps, for sure. This really is not a concern for those of you who just want the TouchPad for browsing or music/pics/Facebook/Twitter/etc. One word of caution: although we do believe apps are coming, we don't believe ALL THREE Tab systems will last. There has to be one (or two) winners, eventually. We all know Apple will be around, and now that Android has developed such a major following and has proven its ability to make up huge ground in the phone App market, we do have some serious concern that WebOS COULD --COULD-- be at a serious disadvantage in apps. If they can't make up ground quickly, the way Android did with Apple, there is a danger that its app store will never materialize. And that will kill the TouchPad. We'll see, but it is a point of concern worth noting. WebOS is, after all, third in line, here. The Winner: iPad2/Apple (for now). Follow this closely and stay tuned here for updates on how the apps are coming along. Issue 3: Hardware and Specs Our Take: Why buy a Tablet that's as heavy as a textbook? The whole point of creating a tablet was portability and carrying ease. After all, we had laptops, and those seemed easy enough, but the Tablet improved upon even that to make an easier and more practical experience. We believe that .5 lb difference in weight is a HUGE difference in portability of a Tablet. The Galaxy just feels wonderful. It's like carrying a light but sturdy clipboard. Remember how cool the general in Color War looked moving around with ease with clipboard in hand? The iPad2 is ALMOST as sleek, just a drop heavier, but you can feel the difference. The TouchPad is bulky, like a light textbook. If the difference in weight doesn't matter to you, you can safely ignore this. But I'd suggest going to a store and picking up and holding all three. Here was our immediate first impression when picking up each device for the first time: Galaxy: (With a smile) ""Wow that is light."" iPad2: ""Not bad! Almost as light as the Galaxy."" Touchpad: ""Whoa, that's kind of heavy."" We should point out that TouchPad's wireless dock charging scores major coolness/convenience points and that the Galaxy's screen resolution seemed the most impressive and brilliant to us. Clearly iPad is lagging behind in terms of pure hardware/specs. The Winner: The Galaxy Issue 4: The System/GUI Our Take: The Touchpad gives a first glimpse into the future of Tabs. This is where the TouchPad is a big winner. There is no question that the WebOS system is a peek into the future of what Tablets might be like in 3-5 years. The multi-tasking is wonderful, allowing you to slide through ""cards"" of apps you are using and just pick up where you left off within each app. Terrific, and it really makes you see the serious limitations of the iPad where you have to scroll through pages and pages of apps and open and close them when you want to switch. It almost makes the iPad look outdated. iOS is a terrible way to navigate through the many wonderful itunes apps. Android is in the middle here. It has terrific abilities to customize screens and create widgets that are far more powerful than anything iPad can do, but Touchpad takes it to the next step to the point that you can almost taste the bridge to a PC-like experience. It's not quite there yet, and the system is still somewhat buggy, but it does the best job of making you feel like you are using a PC. Touchpad also has a neat notification system that is more fluid and seems less bothersome and ""naggy"" than iPad and Anbroid's. One KEY area needs to be noted is the keyboard. TouchPad's keyboard is better and easier to use than iPad's but both are FAR behind the Droid's intuitive and revolutionary ""Swype"" technology. If you haven't seen or tried Swype, you should. For some people, this is reason enough to use Android. It makes text input a breeze. The Winner: TouchPad Issue 5: Price Our Take: Lots of competition but Tabs are still expensive. All three devices are priced similarly right now but you clearly get better bang for your buck with the Galaxy or TouchPad whose specs (screen resolution, memory) exceed iPad2. The Winner: Tie- TouchPad and Galaxy Issue 6: So, What should I buy? Our Take: Stick to your brand and reap great rewards. It makes sense to try and stay within your phone brand. You're missing out on so many great features by ""going out of network"", but if that's not an issue, consider your app preferences. If you MUST have all the apps now, go with iPad. If you have faith that the apps will come for TouchPad (or Galaxy/Android) and have some patience, then by all means choose your preference between those devices. Issue 7: Galaxy vs. TouchPad? Ok, you're forcing our hands here. It really is a tough choice, and depends on which things matter to you more (read above). But, gun to our heads, although we LOVE the TouchPad, we have more faith in Android's app store future and just cannot bare lugging around another textbook.

There is no comparison. So far I am happy with the basics - ebook reading, gaming. However, there are a number of downsides that i'm not happy about, which i won't enumerate because below is a review that says it all! I would have given it 2 stars, but i'm enjoying it so far, although i wish i could edit documents on it. Also the wifi doesn't pick up well in weak areas, so unfortunately i'm stuck with going to a public area where there is strong wifi. so no movies and some games for me. and i'm limited to how much music or docs i can keep on the kindle itself. and #1 bad: I HATE the One-Click thing! so here it is... The following review is from Cnet reviews websites it is confirmed that when Kinde Fire's Silk internet browser is pointed at the Android market, it reverts to the Amazon market - they only want you to get apps from Amazon store. Other ""nice"" features of Kindle Fire include: - It runs hot; - The stereo speakers are both on top of the device, which means that when watching movies they are both on the same side, turning them into mono sound; - Slower and jerkier than expected web browsing thus no benefit from Silk; - Just 6.5Gb storage free at startup; - Prime movies can't be downloaded, only streamed, making them impossible to watch without Wi-Fi; - many defective units being reported; - The home page carousel shows everything you ever bought and every site you visited, with no way to delete items, which means compromising items you bought or sites you visited can't be removed. There goes your privacy; - Touchscreen being reported as having a sluggish response, lack of physical back button and virtual back button being sluggish and not always at the same place; - Power cord is too short to be able to use device at the same time as it charges; - Power button is badly placed, leading to accidental turning off of the device (a lot of complains about this one); - Wi-Fi connection problems are being frequently reported; - Does not support proxy servers, making it difficult to connect to the internet outside the home environment; - Does not support ad-hoc connections so you can't use the 3G connection from your phone with tethering. The most serious one turns out to be that the Kindle is activated to allow for 1-Click shopping through the account connected to the device, and such behavior cannot be turned off. Additionally the device asks for no confirmation password before validating the purchase, which means that if anyone gets hold of the device, he can purchase things at will. Take a look at Nook Tablet has been getting rave pro reviews on the web and it is the best device in it's class. It's got Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, Angry Brids, etc., the best battery life, the best screen, double the RAM and space for apps/photoes/movies, microSD slot and a microphone for Skype (not on Kindle), physical volume controls on the side (not on Kindle) and much zippier performance during video playback and apps usage than choppy/laggy act of Kindle Fire according to many user and pro's reviews.",24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8

I didn't want to get them a computer because they are complicated to work with for kids, they take forever to boot up and you have virus issues, file deletion issues, a tablet just seems perfect. The price is about at the point where its not too expensive and yet not cheep either. When I got the item it was too tempting not to open before Christmas. I have used it about as much as the kids. I love that it is so simple and fast to turn on. I sometimes use it for browsing but the screen is small, yet its functional. The zoom functions are about the same as most touch screens so you can zoom in and shrink things down. The fact that it comes with Amazon prime for a month is great too. I ran through and downloaded a ton of things and installed everything I could that was a good price. Reading books is also decent once you change the setting for the background screen color and the text color. I have mine set to a tan color which is nice but not as good as the ink functions on the other Kindles. Over all I am very happy with this purchase, however there are a few things I don't like at all. The big thing that bothers me is that the product is setup to buy on Amazon with one click.

I had friends who really liked their kindles and I thought Id like the smaller, more manageable size. Out of the box, I had a really exasperating time trying to get it to connect to my home wireless network.

Strike one for the kindle. Web browsing, both at home and on my work network is a little slow, but adequate. I'll find out when I use it more to access the web which will probably not be at home. Much larger screen size on the ipad or my laptop makes those a far more functional choice for web browsing. My choice of the kindle was primarily for reading. One of the things I like about the other kindles is the non-glare screen with the e-ink display. The fire, unfortunately, has a screen which more resembles the ipad, making it difficult to read in direct light and with numerous reflections on the screen.

Had it for over a month, so ready to say, I love this thing. I imagine most Tegra 2/Android 3 tablets would be about the same - the advantage here is the SD card slot, full size and mini USB, and HDMI port. So, how often have I actually used them...or needed to? I have used a PS3 controller to play Shadowgun and hooked the HDMI up just to check it out. Both worked flawlessly with no effort on my part.

I'm gonna start with the bad because i'm a negative individual. =) Ok the app store for this device has little support. Especially with Gameloft and some other high end games. This more has to do with the play store in general but buying an app to find out it doesn't work and hopefully staying with in the 15 minute window so that you can return the app is a pain. Sometimes it takes 20 minutes or more just for the app to recognize the program as being payed for and not stolen so it will take you 20+ minutes just to start the app and then you have to hassle with the developer.

It also made it obvious that touch sensitivity is VERY app-specific because some apps still have issues -- most notably those that don't register touches on buttons unless you touch flatly with your finger and hold a long time (but not TOO long...). I don't normally write reviews, but as a the owner of several prior Kindles AND an iPad I thought some perspective might help potential buyers make their decisions. First and foremost: This is NOT an iPad. If that's what you want, then save your money and get that fine, gold-standard product. You will be happier. If you're an iPad owner who's also been admiring Android devices, but couldn't justify spending another $500 for one of those, Kindle Fire may be for you. In my case, I wanted something less-bulky than iPad for certain situations and the Fire's form factor works great. Plus I've been waiting for an Android device I could use for app development and again, Fire works great. Caveat on app development: It's not rocket science to get it going, but Amazon didn't make it as simple/easy as some other manufacturers (Samsung, Motorola). You'll need to manually edit some driver files on Windows 7 to get going (or use a Mac/Linux PC) and there are some differences with the Fire UI that aren't documented well and have even caught companies like Rovio off-guard. Lastly, you'll need to acquire a data cable. If you're someone who's been drooling over tablets but unable/unwilling to part with $500+ for a toy, then Kindle Fire will be very attractive. And so long as you don't expect iOS butter-smooth UI, Kindle Fire should sate your technolust. FWIW I've used 20+ Android devices and NONE of them has iOS-like smooth UI except possibly the very latest ICS phones. It's not something Kindle-specific. Software wise, the browser on Kindle Fire is what I'd call minimally acceptable. It's nowhere near as good as Mobile Safari, but it's not as bad as Mobile Opera. It's also slow - but functional enough to do most of what you'll want to do with it. Where it really needs work, however, is in the realm of UI - it just feels clunky and awkward to INTERACT with web pages (browsing/reading them is fine). What's really nice is this device is as capable as any other at running the apps you'll actually care about, which makes it as useful and playful as you'd like. The caveats to this are (1) Google apps aren't installed by default and it appear difficult to install them; and (2) 6GB...only 6GB of storage. That only works if you keep it for apps and stream all your media. Lastly, regarding hardware, you'll have to zen with the choices Amazon has made. I don't agree with most of them, but they're hardly deal-killers. Poor placement of the power button has been beat to death and is certainly true, as is lack of buttons for volume control. It's definitely thick & heavy for what you get as well, but at least it feels solid -- so many ""cheapie"" Android devices don't. Sound is moderately acceptable, but the screen is very nice -- both in touch response as well as visual quality. Any touch issues on this device (and it certainly has a few!) are due to software, which Amazon has said they'll be addressing soon. In summary: If you want an iPad, buy an iPad. If you want an inexpensive Android device or a more-capable upgrade for you existing Kindle, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better product.",2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2

I got a pretty nice deal price-wise on Woot for this device, so I don't feel *too* bad about it. But if I had paid the going Amazon rate, I would have called this purchase abysmally disappointing. As the device stands, if you can get it sub-300 dollars, it is a ""good enough"" medium term device. By ""good enough"" I mean the following: The tablet sector is probably 2 years away from full maturity. Two years from now the OS codebase will be mature, the devices will have better processors, better build quality, better battery life, and a larger library of tablet-specific apps. This device is probably ""good enough"" to tide someone over until then.

As a lead in - I am a bit of a junkie when it comes to Gadgets. I have owned the Orignal Kindle - Kindle II & III - and found them all to be great in their time I own 2 Original IPADS and an IPAD 2 I have also always purchased the latest Apple Iphone & have 2 4S units Noting that - the Kindle Fire was not expeted to be an APPLE IPAD killer or replacement for me. I purchased 2 - 1 as a gift and one for family. The over reaction to the 1 click - is just that - an over reaction - it prompts you immediately and notes it can be turned off. There are also several security settings that will allow you to adjust The extra unit - I purchased as a gift - was easily re-set to factory defaults - allowing me to easily gift the item. My first impressions are that this is a nice quality product, exceptional value, and seems very easy to use - even with 300 + books in my library. Knowing Amazon - and knowing this is a 1st rev unit - it will only get better. IMHO - The 7"" screen provides excellent resolution- nothing higher is required on this size screen and price point Yes - I wish you could hide or filter items bought - as this could ruin a Christmas or Present surprise - but that is no different than Amazon's Web site. - I called Amazon and asked if there was a way to do this through the background - and it is not available. - An alternative option was to create a new login - and share my prime membership- (4 are allowed) - unfortunately - this doesn't share your library - I would suggest we all send in request - and Amazon will take it into serious consideration As for the the rest of this mini review - initial impressions is that it is much better build quality, and has a solid feel. Screens move adequately - and overall ease of use is nice - I agree with other reviews - a volume up/down and home button would be a plus....but aren't deal killers for me. The real value will be the Amazon Prime content - streaming TV - Movies - and the lending library - combine that with the thousands of free and low priced Kindle books and this appears to be a great early unit The reading experience - though not as easy on the eyes as E-Ink- is easily modified with a change of background - and doesn't require a case with a separate reading light. The light with the original Kindle is great - but adds a premium - when you factor in a back light on this unit - it is like saving $50-$60 I like the soft tactical feel of the back - and the screen does not appear to need a Zagg Skin - for extra protection - another $$ saver I have not fully tested the unit - but hope some of the hysterics about 1 click and all can be put in proper prospective Hope this helps",10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9

The tablet weighs only about as much as my paper sketchbook, and with the folding Moko case I purchased it looks like one as well. I have it loaded up with Autodesk Sketchbook Pro, Photoshop Touch, and Adobe Ideas, a suite of software that cost me less than $25. Another one to check out is Truesculpt if you like to play with digital clay. Sketchbook and Photoshop both support the pressure function which is exactly what I wanted. Adobe Ideas is a vector paint program which can output files to Illustrator. I like the larger screen size on this tablet in comparison to the iPad, and the pressure sensitive pen is something that just isn't an option on most other tablets. The response of the stylus on the Thinkpad is almost as good as that on the Wacom digitizer built into my Thinkpad X61 laptop convertible, though it's necessary to do a quick pinch zoom for the tiny details. The ability to intuitively switch between multitouch and pen interface on the fly is a key feature that the X61 just doesn't have. As a bonus, it's also an Android tablet, so with 2 dozen free/cheap apps it can do most things you'd expect from a laptop, in a much smaller footprint. There are a few must haves from the app market, like PdaNet Tablet tethering software when wifi isn't available, Orientation Switcher for forcing screen orientation in apps like Photoshop that are locked to one orientation, and something like ES File Explorer for navigating folders Windows-style and moving files to your PC (the bundled ""USB File Copy"" is junk.) I am also a big retro gamer and this tab is great portable fun with a few emus and a couple Wiimote controllers. There is a fair amount of bloatware bundled with the tablet. For starters, I really am not a fan of the handwritten notes on this thing. You'll have to write pretty neatly or you can expect a lot of errors. The onscreen keyboard is a far better option, even one-handed. There is a network printing app that comes installed, which apparently supports most printers and allows printing from Gmail, web pages, photos, messages, Google Docs and other general documents (text files, pdfs) but it only gives you 20 pages before you must buy it. I expected this to be a free feature on a tablet touted as a business tool. The full size SD card is a nice feature, since it allows you to easily add storage for about 1/2 the price of getting it stock. The full-size USB jack is a nice touch but only seems to support thumb drives, mice and keyboards. Don't expect it to support a portable hard drive, none that I have tried have worked. But the thumb drive option is another way to expand storage, and you can plug in a mouse and up pops a little pointer, which is kind of neat. Battery life is very good. With the screen at 50-75% brightness (plenty even for outdoors) and surfing on wifi continuously, I have indeed gotten the claimed 8+ hours on a single charge. However, recharging is VERY slow with the included 2 amp usb charger, especially while using the tablet. Expect to leave it overnight. You won't get any charge at all if you try to use your puny phone charger so don't even try it. Have not tried charging it off a PC but I suspect your average USB jack is not going to have the juice. There is a separate cradle available that claims 3x faster charging so that is an option. My main complaints about this tablet are with the hardware buttons and system stability. The buttons on this pad are pretty useless. You must press them along the edge nearest the screen or they do not work. This is all fine because the same buttons appear on screen, and these are much more responsive. At the same time, it is pretty easy to hit the hardware buttons accidentally while handling the tablet, and I tended to accidentally launch the browser or bounce to the home screen for the first few days when holding the tablet. But you do get used to holding it from one of the other 3 edges or corners after a little use, and a folio case makes this even less of an issue. Be aware that it takes about a full second for the screen to come on when pressing the power button, you may find yourself turning it on and off if you are too impatient. I also get a LOT of forced closes on some of the apps, particularly the browser. At least it gets the crashing over with quickly and the app comes back up in an instant. Hopefully a future update could fix this. The one built in speaker is pretty weak. Considering I have nice loud stereo speakers on my little Xperia Playstation phone, this is something they could have paid attention to, but I always have earbuds with me so not a big issue. Overall I really like this tablet. It's got plenty of power for the graphic intensive stuff, while being reasonably compact and light.",0,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4

It's 200 bucks which is less than half the cost of an entry level iPad 3, so one shouldn't be surprised that it doesn't do everything that that device does. But there are a few not so minor gripes I DO have with the Fire that people should be aware of before picking one up: 1) The lack of storage space - 8GB of hard drive space(really more like 6.5 after factoring in the OS) isn't great but is manageable if you take advantage of Amazon Cloud. But since Amazon left out any memory card slot in the Fire, that's the most space you'll ever have on the actual device. An unfortunate oversight. 2) The inability to organize eBooks by subcategories - Why the more basic Kindles have this option and the Fire doesn't is beyond me. You can organize the entire list of eBooks by Author, Recent, or Title. That's it. No option for a subfolder with the author's name or the genre(i.e. fiction, non-fiction, etc.). The $79 Kindle 4 allows this. Thankfully this is something that could theoretically be fixed easily with a firmware update. The question is will Amazon bother. 3) Weak battery - Everywhere specs are posted, they say the Fire runs for 8 hours(7.5 if you disable wi-fi). It's probably closer to 5 considering how often I've had to recharge it thus far. Not the end of the world, but if you're on a long flight or road trip, it could be a problem. I don't want this review to sound like I'm unhappy with the purchase. I really dig the Kindle Fire. For a $199 tablet, it's hard to beat. But I think some of the reviews online(both from professionals and regular folks) are either glossing over or are oblivious to some of the aforementioned issues I've had with it, and I think people need to know that stuff upfront. Particularly the lack of subcategories for books. If you're gonna use this almost exclusively as an eReader, you'd be better off going with a different(and cheaper) Kindle. Otherwise if in addition to books, watching movies, listening to songs, and playing with apps(the few that are offered anyway) are your thing, then I highly recommend the Kindle Fire.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm a gamer with a PSP, 3DS, DS, XBox, PS2, Wii, and an iPod touch I bought so I'd never have to play the 'I need my apps!' game when buying a phone again. I'm a military medic who works night shifts, deploys, and goes on TDYs so I need something that goes with me. I'm a cook/baker who hates having to go back and forth between her computer and her kitchen when looking at a new meal idea. I play D&D, Pathfinder, and other tabletop RPGs so I love being able to access my characters and books easily without lugging around all of my stuff every time. Last but not least I'm a regular Kindle owner with no intention of getting rid of the one I already have. That said here's wanted when I bought my Kindle: -Something that did a little bit of everything -Something I could bring with me to the gym that I could set on the treadmill and watch movies or listen to a book while I ran. -Something easily portable for short trips, TDYs, and my upcoming cruise -Something that didn't have the huge price tag of the iPad -Something backed by a company that has taken care of me above and beyond even my best expectations time and time again -Something that connected with my home wifi as well as wifi on the go that I could move with ease I wasn't looking for massive storage or something for my music, I have an iPod for that. I wasn't looking for a gaming device, I have systems for that. And I wasn't looking for another eReader. All in all, thus far I'm happy. It runs fast, does more than I expected it to, and is a perfect size for my needs. I will almost certainly use it when cooking this Thanksgiving and will be able to leave my netbook at home on my cruise and take it instead. When I packed my bag for work tonight I was able to leave my regular Kindle, DVDs, and 3DS at home. I'm currently watching The Walking Dead as I type this and have been playing Angry Birds in between calls. Do I think this would sufice for a computer on a deployment? No, but then I don't think an iPad would for me either. Would extra storage be nice? Yeah I guess so but I don't need that much and the cloud has worked well for me so far. So for me, this works. But for people who seem determined to gripe about how this tablet or that tablet doesn't 'do enough' need to realize what a tablet is. A tablet is a portable mini computer that isn't built to do everything as good as the original object.

They all seemed to have pros and cons but the Acer Iconia won me over because of the flexibility of linking devices through USB port and adding additional memory ith micro SD card. I was till not sure of what I would do with it having never played with a tablet before but nevertheless off I went to Best Buy and got my first Iconia. I also have never used Android OS previously. Got home, went through the set and straight away experienced the wi-fi connection problems referred to in other reviews. I just could not get a connection even with the tablet on top of my laptop woorking perfectly through wi-fi, and with a friend next to me connected just fine on her iPad. So back I went to Best Buy really unsure as to what to get next because as I mentioned they all have problems described in reviews. They convinced to try another Iconia and so I took my 2nd tablet home. This one worked perfectly and still does! Even where the connection is weak it still works. I didn't have any problems setting it up and it is very intuitive even for a first time Android / tablet user. I have now had it for a couple of weeks and there is nothing I can't do on it! I have tried photos, movies, connecting to a key, mouse, reading books, magazines, listening to the radio, connecting to my laptop, playing games. There are plenty of free apps in the Android market which enable all these activities. The only thing I can think of which I have not tried is to load music but I have my ipod for that. And the only problem I have experienced is with email. Gmail works 100% however with my other exchange account it will not accept the outbound settings. So I can receive mail but I cannot send. I tried the email app that coms with the tablet and K-9 mail. If anyone can advise me further I will really appreciate it.

"142","R10HMNUU689XRQ","B0051VVOB2","","1/10/2012","A5SLVT5DHKRNN",FALSE,FALSE,4,"Honest Review for Kindle Fire","First a bit of background: I am a 26 year old college student. I am definitely ""tech savvy"" but not part of the popular crowd when it comes to choosing devices. I have always been reluctant with this whole touch based interface that phones and computers are using today. I have never owned a smartphone of any kind, nor have I ever owned a tablet. I have used a friends Droid and I have actually picked up an iPad before so I am not completely ignorant to these new popular devices. I own a LG cosmos and its just fine for me. I have a bitchin desktop at home for everything else. Since mid November I was addicted to watching movies and reading reviews about the fire. I was promised one for christmas and I was really excited to see how it would stand against all the hype and all the bad reviews. I never expected it to be just like an iPad. I expected the Fire to be a glorified e-reader that was capable of handling other types of media. I don't understand why everyone would want to compare it to an iPad because I always thought that an iPad was a complete waste of money. I mean, come on, if you really want to spend that kind of money for a device why not get a damn laptop? That just seems more functional and practical to me. After about two weeks with the Fire I can say that it has honestly surpassed my expectations. For the money this thing can do A LOT. For all the people complaining that it is not a productivity device: I would take a second look at the appstore. I am a mechanical drafting and machining student and this thing has apps like autodesk sketchbook and autocad ws that are perfect for storing and editing drawings. You can easily manage and view online documents with the default office app, and there's even ""cloud briefcase"" apps like evernote, sugarsync, and others. So, I have no idea what people are complaining about in that area. As a college student this works for me. And I have over 100 pdfs of manuals and textbooks at my fingertips all out of my own private collection!!!! As for the slow balky interface and web browser? I do not mind waiting literally 2 seconds for a page to load. The touch screen seems just as responsive as any other device I've used with the same interface (ipad, droid). Sometimes the screen can respond to my finger being really close and I accidently select something I didn't want to but I got used to that very quick. I have thick fingers and I have never had a problem. If you seriously want to complain about that then get yourself a stylus, son. And dolphin browser is available with golauncher described in the next paragraph. For those who do not like the standard background and UI, you can allow 3rd party apps and install golauncher. (right now my home screen resembles ice cream sandwich) And you can do that WITHOUT ROOTING!!!!!!! And with that you can create widgets and have up to 9 screens and 3 task bars. The golauncher apk file is free from their website and you can even download golauncher widgets too! I have a shortcut placed right above the home button which allows me to switch back to the old interface and access my books and documents and amazon video. So there's the answer to that complaint. For those who do not like that there is no external volume controls....: COME ON! is it really that hard to move your finger over a couple inches, tap the bar and slide the volume to the desired level? you are able to control the volume when watching video right on the screen as well. So to those who are whining about that: Stop you lazy bastards... As for the complaint about 1 click purchasing and the lack of parental controls? You parents do realize that you are PARENTS, right? Teach your kid about money and dont give a $200 dollar device to a kid who doesn't understand that it comes with some responsibility. And I believe that you can edit your 1-click purchase options on your amazon account preferences. Just turn it off or get your kid his own bank account connected to their fire. It's like when parents complain about their kids seeing something on TV that is inappropriate: watch your kid, dude. Don't blame others for your own bad parenting. For the complaint that it has no camera or mic? Do you really need that? Maybe those hipsters that like to skype at the local starbucks do, but I sure think its unnecessary. I have a camera on my phone, anyways. And the fact that there's no 3G network? ""Oh no! I can't constantly check my facebook status!"" Yeah that doesn't matter to me. And finally to address the complaint of the power button: I HAVE NEVER ACCIDENTLY TURNED THE FIRE OFF. You do know that to turn it off you need to hold down that button. Pressing it will simply put it into standby mode and pressing it again will bring it back to exactly what you were doing. So that is settled. Bottom Line: (Good, Bad, and yes Ugly) -Good: Great HD video, productive apps, beautiful screen, good size and weight, Games run awesome (namely plants vs zombies and worms), music and net radio apps work GREAT, great for reading books/pdfs/docs/txt, changable interface (for those that are smart enough), and the best part: its only $200!!!! -Bad: Doesn't have every app I wanted (spotify, google skymap and others), Battery life is kind of sucky (I charge it on average once a day), the backing seems like it gets marred and scratched easily so get yourself a case (marware lightweight is good), and lastly you cant do EVERYTHING on it like emulators and better games without rooting it and voiding the warranty. But just give amazon some time to build the appstore and everything will be there I am sure. -Ugly: I have one question for the designer of this tablet. If the best way to view videos on the fire is in landscape, then why did you choose to put both speakers at the top of the device? Seems really strange to me that they are not on one of the longer sides of the fire. Its better to watch videos with headphones because of this. And the speakers are not really that loud so they work better with computer speakers or plugged into a system of sorts. So that's my review... Seems like most of the complaints are inane or easily fixed so all-in-all this is a great buy! For those who think the iPad is better? You are probably right, but its like comparing a lexus to a lamborghini. They are both nice but one is more practical for everyday use.

However, when I tried to turn it on, as other reviewers noted, the screen went black after the initial ""Coby"" logo. Not booting. Tried everything people suggested - resetting with & without sd card, holding ""power+home"" ""power+volume"" to get the factory resetting. But, it sure didn't help. The 2nd one was somebody's return. It had the previous customer's letter to the seller with the RMA# and the defect descriptions... Even with all that, I believe this is a great tablet for the great price and that's why I'm not giving it 1 star.

With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17"" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips. I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc. What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user. I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices. There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for. I purchased a game ""Super Monkey Ball 2"" for iPad and it looks and plays great! I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good. Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me. Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie. Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads ""Safari Cannot open page because the server stopped responding"". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection. Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem. Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release. It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection. It's unpredictable. Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads ""not charging"". I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem. I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users. The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read. It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger. If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it. LIKES: I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection. When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy. The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in. The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from. The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast. It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol I have also used the internet radio while in the shower. You sit the iPad on the toilet seat and turn it full blast. Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations. I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook. I downloaded the digital copy of the latest ""Batman"" movie and it looked and sounded great! Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time. It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17"" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table. I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off. I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg. The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lol When you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed. However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it. Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed. DISLIKES: I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad. You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens. I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself. The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual. the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual. There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting. You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button. The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change. If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video. Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop. Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook. For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem. The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are. Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing. Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works. If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing. The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word. For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed ""OMG"" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted ""OMB"". I didn't notice until I left the comment. This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off. The search feature in iBooks is not as comprehensive as Amazon. For example, you can only search exact titles or authors of books. You can't search by subject mattter. If you search the word ""gay"" it will only bring up books or authors with that word. Where as Amazon it will bring up books that fit the subject matter as well as titles and authors. So you have to know the exact book you are searching for. In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer. If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws. If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself.",5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4

"156","R10IKK163W8WRI","B0051VVOB2","","2/22/2012","AJ8GROPKV1TLR",TRUE,TRUE,5,"Reading - e-ink vs tablet","My primary purpose for buying a Kindle was, of course, for reading. After the introduction of the Kindle Fire, I then had to struggle with the decision of whether to purchase a Kindle Touch (having finally settled on the Touch for its interface and its unique x-ray function) or a Kindle Fire. Initially I thought I couldn't justify the Fire if I only wanted to read, so I bought the Touch, and loved it...until the light in the room started to fade, and then I was always having to worry about lighting. Okay, not that big a deal, right? Then I read Jonathan Safran Foer's beautiful novel Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, and in one chapter there were several pages with color that were displayed in grey tones. I was so intrigued that I just had to see it in color - so I used Kindle PC to look at the pages in color, and they just came alive. That's when I realized how much I missed color. So, next I tackled the lighting problem and ordered a light-weight (lithium battery), Kindle-compatible, clip-on reading light. The first one illuminated the top half beautifully, leaving the bottom half in a different time zone. The second lithium light I tried had a ""goose"" neck and lighted the whole page. But to get the bottom half lighted well, the neck had to be raised high enough so that a glare resulted on the top half. So that one didn't work either. I was very frustrated about not being able to read in dim light or at night, in bed. Two of my friends, also avid readers, had bought Fires at Christmas and were still loving their Kindles. I figured that an extra $100 over the life of the Kindle wasn't that big a deal, especially when you consider that to properly enjoy the Touch would require purchasing (after first finding a suitable) clip-on reading light and separate power adapter. I'm also a Prime member so if I purchased the Fire I could watch all my videos and TV episodes in full color. Finally I did purchase a Fire and I do love it. I don't read for more than 3 or 4 hours at a time, so the back-lighting of the Fire hasn't caused any eye problems. It also has more options for changing the font, size, background, etc. And, of course, since it's an LCD the pictures are crystal clear and can be enlarged for better viewing (I don't think I could enlarge pictures on the Touch - but I'm not certain). The Fire's interface is much faster than the Touch's and slightly more intuitive, e.g., when you highlight a word, the definition directly pops up (on the Touch, when you highlight a word you get a pop-up and there's an extra step of having to select Dictionary, which is still much better than any of the other Kindle e-readers - but the Fire is just more direct). Compared to the Touch, the Fire's two 'shortcomings' are its heavier weight and shorter battery life. Although the Fire is heavier than the Touch I can still comfortably hold the Fire to read, even with one hand. Also, the Fire's screen is 1"" longer than the Touch's and it's surprising how much that 1"" adds to a page. That extra one inch allows enough extra text per page that it results in a real reduction in page turns. But if you're a heavy, daily user the Fire has to be charged every night. If I'm at home, I often read or listen to music with my Fire plugged in to the charger. I confess the recent announcement of impending Kindle Color E-Reader really added a layer of complexity to the whole decision process, and I almost returned my beloved Fire. There's no question that e-ink is more like real print and the color e-reader would obviously address my need for color. But, it still wouldn't solve my problem of needing a clip-on light for using an e-ink reader in dim lighting. Ultimately, for me, that was a bigger problem than the lack of color. Listed below is a comparison of the Touch and the Fire from an e-reader perspective, even though they are technically an e-reader and a tablet. I realize that it's not a fair comparison from a technology standpoint, but hopefully it's helpful for someone trying to decide which one to purchase based on reading functionality. E-READER COMPARISON (not E-READER vs. TABLET) KINDLE TOUCH PROS light weight long battery life x-ray functionality excellent in bright light/sunlight CONS no color no light - needs clip-on reading light when light begins to dim need to purchase power adapter KINDLE FIRE PROS full color self-illuminated faster interface more intuitive interface longer page (screen is 1"" longer, so more text/page, fewer page turns) CONS heavier weight shorter battery life harder to read in bright sunlight (more glare) UPDATE: I just saw a TV commercial from Foster Grant. They are advertising a product called Light Specs, essentially reading-light glasses with LCDs attached to each corner of the frame. It looks like an intriguing design, but as an untested product it's impossible to know whether they would illuminate the whole screen or whether there would be glare on the screen from the LCDs. They might be worth checking out if you elect to go with an e-ink Kindle none of the other clip-on reading lights works for you.",NA,NA,NA,6,10,10,10,10,11,11,11,12,13,13,13,13,13,13,13,13,13,13,13,13,NA,NA,NA,5,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11

But I think I do not make the same expectations as many other people as it has been said more than 100 times... it's just a $199 device! I really like the design. I love reading books in my Kindle Fire. I don't have another Kindle but I guess I will buy a Kindle Touch later on for better experience with reading as after reading for long in the Fire, my eyes get tired. But I have read up to 3 hours straight on the Fire. It takes me 1 hour to go to school and I love the fact that you can just e-mail your Fire some documents and read it there. I do it all the time and read documents on the way to school (in the bus). And now with the exams going on, I put my glossaries there and continue reading at school when waiting for the exam to start.

So I was able to put some music onto the device :) Along with some apps downloaded outside Amazon Appstore. Which comes to my main disappointment! As I live in Europe, and therefore do not own a USA debit or credit card, I cannot download any apps from the Amazon Appstore, not even the free ones!! I don't own an iPhone or an android phone for that matter so I was hoping the Kindle would be able to satisfy my app game need... but the answer to that is no at the moment. I've downloaded some apps from other websites and all the games I've downloaded (f.ex. Angry Birds (all versions), Yoo Ninja, Doodle Fit, and Jelly Defense) haven't been able to work in the Fire. I was able to get the Evernote app, but any other app had some type of glitches so it wasn't usable to me (events in a calendar didn't save and alarm would get error right before alarming me). Before getting my Fire I had written down some apps I wanted to get and I was very excited which made me very disappointed when I found out that I wouldn't be able to get any of those apps... at least not through Amazon appstore. Now I only have Evernote. I wish Amazon would open their appstore soon to the ""International"" market or at least so people can download the FREE apps...

I often use the Fire when I have it close but don't want to go up to my room to get my PC. I often use it to surf the internet, especially Facebook. I really hope that Amazon will open the Appstore to International market soon as being unable to get apps was my main disappointment. Or at least let people download the free apps! Some might think that this review should not give the Kindle Fire four stars, I just love what the Fire will be able to do when not ""closed"" like it is now and I like what I'm able to do with the Fire even when it's closed. It doesn't bother me that it's only wi-fi. Even though I'm ""addicted"" to the internet, I don't need to connect to the internet outside my home, and if I do, I just use my phone.

If you want to use the powerful CPU of this unit and have a hardware decoding of these movies, you will HAVE TO BUY additional piece of software FROM ARCHOS (!) called AC3 Codec for around $20 or so.

The first day after I got this Archos 101 I really wanted to buy several Archos units for my wife and my mum. Now I'd better add 200 more bucks and buy them iPad that will play all movies without any hassle. Congratulations Archos, due to your greed for 20 bucks for this 'AC3 codec' you've just lost an opportunity to sell me at least two more devices that I was almost about to buy. Except for this, I can admit that this Archos is not bad. So, if you don't plan to watch movies on it :-), you can surely buy it.

Good Hardware, much better if you ""hack"" it.","I was concerned about purchasing this tablet due to all the negative reviews out there about the ROM/software and screen angle. I purchased in June 2011, and found the ROM/ Android operating system to be acceptable after the first over the air update to version 3588. I used it a week or two with that stock ROM and really didn't have any problems, so was hesitant to do any tweaking or hacking. The tablet works with flash 10.1 to 10.3 contrary to many of the reviews. There is a link to download it from Viewsonic's website ([...]). As far as the screen, it is really a good screen, but it seems like it works better if you hold it upside down. Holding it normally, in landscape view, It needs to be viewed straight on, or from the top down. If you tilt the top away from you, it gets dimmer, and doesn't look good. As long as you hold it flat to your view you are fine, but after a while the weight gets to you and you start tilting it away. At that point, just flip it over, and you can see it fine from the bottom view (tilted slightly away from your eye). Only problem with this is the switches are in a different position than normal, but I haven't had any real difficulty with that. So the screen is not really a big problem and it actually looks great from the right angles, or holding it upside down in landscape mode. Also during this initial 2 weeks time I was researching on the internet all the various options for 3rd party ROMs to use on the Viewsonic GTablet device. There are many choices in ROMs for the GTablet, from Android 2.2, which it comes with, to 2.3 and 2.4, and also alpha or beta versions with Android Honeycomb 3.0. Anyway, after a while using the default Viewsonic ROM the device stopped being able to find my music. It just quit showing up in the music player. I tried other music players, and copying off and back on the music files, but still no luck. Anyway, I finally got frustrated with this, and decided to take the leap and install a new ROM. It took me 3 attempts to get it to boot properly, having to use both nvflash (needs Windows USB drivers, which were a little difficult to get installed in Win7-64bit) and Clockworkmod. These are both developer tools for changing the ROM. Anyway, there was a lot of information on the internet about the process, and many had tried and run into similar problems before, so a few quick google searches and I got the new ROM installed. I went with a stable version of Andoid 2.3, along with some kernal tweaks that allow overclocking the processor. It really flies now, and works even better than before. It also works with the Google android marketplace once hacked. Of course the Amazon Android marketplace is also very useful and I have made a few purchases there. ;-) Anyway, I am very happy to get a 10.1"" high resolution Android tablet for $300 ($375 with nice carry case and extra 16GB SDHC card (again, from Amazon). It also has made my previous purchase of an internet radio, ipod touch, and Nook ereader not necessary, so those items will be going up on ebay soon. Who knows when I'm done, I may have my total net cost down to less than $200. That would really be awesome!! So if you have a technical bent, and have possibly hacked or cracked devices before, are willing to keep trying until you get it done (ROM change), do not be afraid to purchase a GTablet.

UPDATED REVIEW March 26, 2012","**UPDATE MARCH 26, 2012** I came back to Amazon to update my review now that I've had the Vizio VTab for 4 months. Interestingly enough, there were not as many reviewers posting about problems when I originally researched and purchased my Vizio as there are now. Many reviewers are complaining about the battery life and charging issues. I never had charging issues or battery life issues until a few weeks ago. Then these two issues happened (went wrong) after upgrading to Honeycomb. I do not know if there is a connection between the two or whether they are separate issues. I will say that just a couple of weeks prior to installing the upgrade, I noticed that I was having issues powering the device on. Other than that, I figured I was not holding the button properly for bringing the tablet out of hibernate. Nonetheless, my tablet no longer powers on as of last night. Very sad indeed as I ABSOLUTELY still love the tablet and will not reduce the rating I originally gave it. Obviously, there is a problem and I hope Vizio isn't going broke by giving free replacements. Bottom line, it's obviously a flagship product in beta. :( Purchase at your own risk and know that until Vizio corrects the problems, it IS a purchase risk. Sorry to say but true. I don't want to have to 'return' my product as it does have personal data on it. Honeycomb is (was) working well. I loved the update and afterward I charged the unit, played a few games (2 hrs or less); turned the tablet to hibernate (with plenty of battery left according to the icon), and left it until the following night. I could ALWAYS get 2 to 3 evening of play/work from the tablet (estimating 8 hours of constant time or 2-3 days of a couple hours each day with standby time in between). It would not turn on but would flicker as though it was attempting to turn on. Put it on the charger and the batter was in the red. It should not have been in the red as it reported 90% battery left when it was put into hibernate. Same thing happened the next night after charging it all day. Was good for a couple of hours, hibernated, turned on this a.m. and it won't power on, flicker, nada, nottin'. On the charger now hoping for a miracle. I will update after I figure out how to resolve. ================ ORIGINAL REVIEW: If you read the description for this Vizio tablet, you'll find it spot on. It is ANDROID driven and we love Android. ;) My husband set it up to work as a remote for our (Vizio) television and he says it works great. Notice the ""he said"" as I don't often have access to the remote in the man-cave. ;) I'd like to make a couple of comments in reference to a couple of earlier reviews found posted here. 1) This tablet is WiFi only. If you plan on using its GPS feature, that might be a mute app without WiFi. It does not have 'mobile access' like your mobile phone. It does not require a mobile plan and it can't be used with a mobile plan. Therefore, any connection to the WWW is via WiFi connection only. Think of it as a mini laptop with a WiFi connection. Hence, the less expensive this tablet is in comparison to those that you can use with a mobile plan. 2) Regarding a Facebook app. I do not recommend Facebook on this. If you just want to check in and do limited activity, there is an app called Seismic that can act as a hub and connect you with Twitter, Facebook and a few others. It will stream the 'recent activity' of these social media sites. You can Tweet, Like, share, comment and more. Better than fooling around with security issues that Facebook hasn't remedied yet. We immediately purchased a 32GB SDHC Class 10 micro card to take full advantage of the extra space and install apps to the card as opposed to eating up the 2GB available on board the tablet. If you have already installed apps on the tablet's memory while waiting to spring for the 32GB card (or smaller), not a problem. You can easily transfer the apps from the tablet to the micro card later, with the touch of a finger. Why a Class 10? It's still compatible and a bit speedier than a Class 4 or 6. If you don't care about any of that, go for an SDHC card with less than a Class 10 rating and save some money in the process. This makes a very nice household helper. You can store a budget, a grocery list, recipes, notes to / from the spouse or kids; list your contacts, phone numbers, medicines, whatever you would like it to do for you in ways to make your life simpler or easier, you will have a friend with this little helper. Battery life is as it states. However, if you are using it a lot throughout the day, it may run down a bit quicker BUT it still has a longer life than you'd expect. We get a couple of days in standby mode (little use) before we have to charge it again. If you are a Netflix member, you can use the Netflix app to access your account (in a WiFi location) and watch movies in bed!

I was way off. The Silk browser takes between 15 and 20 times as long to load a web page, compared to my ipad on the same network. I timed several webpages loading on both at the same time. Email works, but takes about double the time to load, and won't let you pinch to zoom, which is a problem because of the small font and screen size. The pinch to zoom works on other apps choppy, when it works at all, compared to the ipad that always works perfectly. The app store has nowhere near as many or as good apps, and way less free apps compared to the Apple app store.

I have been using it extensively for IM, web surfing, playing games, and watching videos. I have really had no complaints. (None that can be laid at the feet of the device, anyway.) The Honeycomb operating system is elegant and easy to use. Acer's additions are also nice, and not terribly intrusive. There are some app 'groups' to make your experience a bit more streamlined, and the Acer Clear.fi media sharing software. Older Android apps work as well, with a few exceptions. However, once you find some tablet-optimized apps, you'll find yourself hungry for more. There's really no comparison between the slick UI of a tablet app like TweetComb and the ""everything is full screen"" experience of an Android 2.x app. Typing is surprisingly comfortable. If the tablet is resting on a stand or easel case, it's very simple. If you plan to work mostly with the device in-hand, I would suggest checking out Thumb Keyboard or something similar that lets you type at the edges of the screen. (I'm in the beta for Swiftkey X for Tablets and it's easy to use.) Games are responsive and pretty. I have played Angry Birds and Galaxy on Fire 2 extensively, and the experience is very smooth. The built in USB host port has been useful already, for transferring files off my USB thumb drive. Video takes a bit more work, but is still pretty easy. Out of the box, the system is compatible with H.264 (mp4) video. If you have a library of video files you'd like to use that don't match that, RockPlayer, VPlayer, and more are all out there waiting to be installed from the market. I gave this system a 4 instead of a 5 because of the power adapter. It's a proprietary power adapter, so there is no charging it from the PC. In addition, the cord is really too short for comfortable use while plugged in. However, battery life is great.

"244","R10VKMPFNY5FS7","B0051VVOB2","","11/28/2011","A3GZ22JLTTI2V6",TRUE,TRUE,4,"Great Addition to E-Ink Tech Kindle","I read constantly and if this was my first experience with the Kindle I would be devastated. The E-Ink technology used for the other versions of the Kindle (even the $79 Kindle) is far, far, far superior to the backlit display of the Fire for reading. If you read a lot, spend an extra $100 or so and get another Kindle in addition to this one. You won't regret it because reading with the e-ink tech is just as soothing as reading a paper book. After having my Kindle Fire for about three days I promptly ordered one for my niece for Christmas. I love the features - Facebook, email, streaming free movies and television shows. In addition to the movies and tv shows (I'm currently halfway through the first season of the now-cancelled ""Saving Grace"") I love that I can download and play music. It is very user friendly. My five year old twins keep confiscating my Kindle Fire to watch ""Super Why"" episodes, National Geographic, Sesame Street and kid-friendly movies. And yes, they do this all by themselves! A recent trip to the pediatrician was a real dream - my contagious little guys were happy to sit quietly and watch a movie. They are learning to read, and the children's books are incredible. But the biggest testimonial happened this morning. My hubby worked an overtime detail involved him sitting in his patrol car watching a construction site all night. He has a Kindle Keyboard 3G and was planning to take just that. Late last night, I quickly rented a movie I know he's been wanting to watch, spent 60 seconds showing him how to use my Kindle Fire and sent him on his way. My extremely NOT technology savvy hubby came home at 8 a.m. with a huge smile and announced: ""I WANT ONE!"" He watched his rented downloaded movie and then happily started watching free episodes of Star Trek DS-9 until his shift finally ended. Our other Kindle books downloaded right onto the Fire, but again, this is NOT the Kindle I will be using for most of my reading. But it is still oh so much fun and has a myriad of other uses! Don't waste your time or money on screen protectors - you don't need them. And I'm not happy with my case - I would prefer something that would allow the Kindle to stand up. But I'm still very happy with my Fire!",11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11

First off, if you want an Ipad, or whatever tablet it is that you are thinking of, then by all means, go out and spend hundreds of dollars on it. Its your choice. PLEASE DON'T GIVE THIS TABLET BAD REVIEWS BASED ON THE FACT THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE YOUR RESEARCH. Check out the Amazon reviews, Google and you tube, you have references at your fingertips, use them, and ask questions!! I will get off my soapbox now..... For a starter tablet I think it's the best on the market after researching all over for one with at least 512mb of ram , a 1ghz processor and a front facing camera. I purchased this so I could read books, go on you tube and check email which this tablet does with ease. Download the Amazon app store..... PROS: - Very responsive and quick, even with Resistive Screen technology. - Excellent price. - Great screen definition. - No Android market access, but the apps library has a lot of (Cheesy) apps. Additionally, you can directly install a lot Android 2.2 & 2.3 apps via the SD card. Not sanctioned, but there is a way to install Android Market. - It has USB capability, albeit difficult to locate folders at first (need to look for ""tflash"" folder for SD Card and ""scsi_sda1"", ""scsi_sdb1"", ""scsi_sda2"", etc for USB Flash Drives). - You can also access external hard drives, providing they are FAT. CONS: - Initial frequent disconnects from WI-FI. This causes the Apps Library to crash. The only way to fix it is reboot. I enabled the guest access on my Belkin and set it to WEP and still have WI-FI disconnect issues. UPDATE: The WI-FI issue has resolved itself. I even reverted back to WPA2 without any issues. Changed rating back to 5 Stars. - Micro SD card slot is finicky if you have to remove and install a micro SD card on a regular basis. - No Bluetooth. Bottom line, this is a great introductory tablet. I only wanted an ebook reader, but decided to get a little more capability. Well worth the price. It is a very good tablet for the PRICE....",4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4

Overall, it is a great laptop, but needs some initial tweaking to run smoothly. Pros: Fast for its size: The 2.67Ghz core i5 is extremely fast for a laptop and 4gb of ram is plenty. Programs open quickly and PDF files are very smooth when using tablet mode. If you don't clog up the laptop with all kinds of gunkware, it will run better than you want it to. For me, using a fast touch screen is faster than using a mouse in a lot of applications. Easy to use tablet: The tablet screen is very easy to swivel and the laptop is lightweight for its speed (3.8lbs, 5lbs with extra battery) The screen and form factor are also very easy for handling and viewing. Battery expansion: The internal battery on this is rated at about 5 hours, but I get about 4hrs 20min out of it on low power mode. Note that this is after I removed a LOT of the default software that came with the computer. Using a higher power mode will probably get you 3hrs 30min on a full charge. The great thing about this laptop is the optional ultraslim battery (RX932AA). This will give you an additional 4+ hours on the system making your overall battery live 7-8 hours! Awesome for a full sized laptop! (Note that the RX932AA says its for the 2710p, but it works with the 2740p as well) Cons: HP Default Software: I removed a lot of the applications the tablet came with for several reasons. A) Not useful to me B) Free applications worked better C) Took up too much power Customizing: The default touch screen driver that comes with the laptop doesn't work well. I had to replace it with this one: ""sp49201.exe"" (available on the HP support site, just Google it) and now everything works perfectly. --- This is a great laptop if you need something portable with tablet functionality. After a little tweaking, it runs quickly. I would recommend this for a traveling businessman, student, or someone who really enjoys tablet functionality on a fast laptop. Though it's a little expensive, you definitely get what you pay for if you tweak it a little bit at the beginning.",8,9,9,10,11,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,8,9,9,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11
